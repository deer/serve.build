/**
 * Merge helper for {@code $defs} maps shared by every {@link ToolParam#defs()} implementation.
 *
 * <p>{@code defName} is an author-chosen string with no enforced namespacing, so two independently
 * declared {@link ToolParam#lazy} params can collide on the same name. Merging silently (last-write-wins)
 * would leave one param's {@code $ref} pointing at the wrong schema with no signal anything went wrong —
 * so a collision between two <em>different</em> schemas for the same {@code defName} is rejected outright.
 * Re-merging the same {@code defName} with an identical schema (e.g. the same {@code lazy} param reachable
 * through more than one path) is fine and a no-op.
